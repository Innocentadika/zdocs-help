# OBJECT ORIENTED SOFTWARE DESIGN METHODS

1. Study the following scenario and answer the questions that follow:

The schedule of classes for each term is produced in advance of the pre-registration date according to a timetable prepared by the records office. By a date contained in the timetable, each department in the university must submit a list of classes scheduled for the term in question. These lists are combined to form a printed class schedule. The schedule is distributed free for each department office and to each professor; students must buy their own schedule at the bookstore.During the pre-registration period, students request the classes they would like to take, using a touch — tone telephone. Each class request contains the student’s identifier and the identifier of the class for which the student wishes to register. If that class is not available, the student may try to enroll in a different section of the same course or in another class.
After a student has registered for as many classes as possible (up to the maximum number of units permitted), a class list is printed for that student. It shows the class in which the student has been enrolled.
A class roster, containing a list of the student’s names and identifier is printed for the lecturer teaching each class. The list is ordered alphabetically by the student’s last name.

    i. Analyze THREE functional requirements of the system.
    ii. Identify THREE main actors of the system.
    iii. Draw a use case diagram.
    iv. Convert the above use case diagram to a class diagram.

2.  Draw a deployment diagram for a ring network with two servers running windows Server 2000 and IIS, and two clients running Linux and Firefox browser.

3.  Explain THREE differences between Structured System Analysis and Design and Oject-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design.

4.  Describe the phases of the Iterative/Incremental Object-Oriented System Analysis and Design.

5.  As an analyst in your own organization, one of your key projects today is designing software for managing sales and marketing process. This software will take enquiries and orders and channel them to respective departments for processing and order fulfilment. Draw an Activity diagram of your choice, clearly indicating the following notations.

        i. Initial or start point
        ii. Termination point
        iii. Decisions point
        iv. Termination point
        v. Object flow

6.  Suppose you were to use an object-oriented approach to analyse and design a system for developing a web-based system;

            i. Outline the goals of UML in this exercise
            ii. Explain how UML would benefit you in the process.
            iii Discuss the major factors that have promoted the use of UML in the OOAD industry.

7.  Given that two users are likely to give varying opinions on the requirements of a system to be developed, explain how would a system analyst go about collecting requirements.

8.  You have been selected as a software designer for KANYAGIA IT department, you are required to come up with a registration system, draw an interaction overview diagram,clearly demonstrating your understanding on all aspects of an activity diagram.

9.  Briefly describe the following features of Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design using relevant example:

        i. Encapsulation
        ii. Polymorphism
        iii. Data Abstraction
        iv. Inheritance

10. Discuss three major causes of software project failure, highlighting how this failure can be avoided.

11. A dental surgeon maintains records for patients who may belong to either private or health service categories. For each patient, the surgeon records personal information such as name, address, phone number, and date of birth, along with either the health service number or the payment method. Draw a class diagram for the above use-case, include class attributes, to represent the information given in the paragraph above.

12. Using well labeled diagram explain the package diagram clearly illustrating Dependencies and Visibility within the diagram.

13. A customer arrives at a bank to open anew account. The customer requests for the new account form, fills the same and submits it for verification by the teller. The customer also gives an initial minimal deposit. At the end of the process the customer receives a passbook.

            i. Create a sequence diagram for this procedure.
            ii. Convert the above sequence diagram to a collaboration diagram.

14. A weather mapping system is required to generate weather maps on a regular basis using data collected from remote, unattended weather stations and other data sources such as weather observers, balloon and satellites. Weather stations transmit their data to the area computer in response to a request from that machine. The area computer system validates the collected data and integrates the data from different sources. The integrated data is archived and, using data from the archive and a digitized map database, a set of local weather maps is created. Maps may be printed for distribution on a special purpose map printer or may be displayed in a number of different formats.

            i. Identify at least two candidate classes.
            ii. For each class identified in (i) above, identify at least two operations.
            iii. For each class identified in (i) above, identify at least two data members.
            iv. Using a well-illustrated diagram draw a class relationship from the above narrative.
