# Computer Organization and Architecture

1. Explain Three characteristics of modern-day computers.

2. A computer system is advertised as having an "i3 @ 2.5 GHz, 96K byte DRAM memory, and a 2.1 Gigabyte hard drive." Interpret this computer.

3. A computer's memory is accessed through various mechanisms including seek time, rotational latency, and transfer time. Explain how these mechanisms facilitate memory access.

4. Describe Three technologies used in designing computer systems, giving suitable examples.

5. Analyze Three factors that give multiprocessor systems superiority over uniprocessor systems in computer organization.

6. Using a suitable diagram, describe the structure of memory organization in a computer system, explaining the characteristics of each level.

7. If the bus has 8 data lines, at most one 8-bit byte can be transferred at a time. How many memory accesses would be needed in this case to transfer a 32-bit instruction from memory to the CPU.

8. The Von Neumann model represents the architecture of a modern-day computer architecture. As a designer, describe the implementation of this architecture.

9. Using suitable examples, analyze the significance of Caches and registers in a computer system.

10. Describe the architecture that defines how data is read and written onto optical and magnetic discs, appreciating the technologies implemented in each.

11. The operating system reads and writes data to and from memory for processing in the CPU. Explain how addressing schemes aid in this process. Give Two examples to support your answer.

12. Convert the following accordingly:

- 3210 to hexadecimal
- 4DA to Binary

13. Illustrate the organization of the main components of a computer system, clearly explaining the function of each.

14. Describe Five major steps involved in the instruction cycle.
