# Structured Programming and Algorithms

1. Explain what you understand by the term programming paradigm.

2. Differentiate between the following as used in computer programming:

   -i. Source code and Object code.

   -ii. Compiler language and interpreter.

3. Analyze at least FOUR factors that led to the faster adoption of structured programming languages in the early 1970s as opposed to the initial languages of Pascal, Fortran, etc.

4. Explain the following operators as used in programming, giving examples in each case:

   -i. Bitwise operators.

   -ii. Relational operators.

   -iii. Logical operators.

5. Analyze the phases involved in program development, detailing each phase.

6. Design a C code that enables users to enter the principle amount, rate, and time; hence enable the computation of compound interest and simple interest. If compound interest is larger than simple interest, the user can invest using compound interest, and vice versa.

7. Differentiate a compiler from an interpreter.

8. Observe the following C code below. From the code, specify what this code does and give the final output of the code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
    int a, b;
    int result;
    a = 10;
    b = 5;
    result = a - b;
    printf("The result is %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

9. Create a program that prompts the user to enter their name.

10. Using sample pseudo-code, show a variable declaration with data-type for five data types used in the C programming language.
11. Define the term control structure as used in programming languages.

12. Create a C program that uses a for loop statement to count from 1 to 100 in reverse order.

13. Contrast two testing strategies used to test a developed application before rolling it out to the users for use.

14. Write a program that prints odd numbers within the range of 1-100, justifying the use of "for" loop in programming constructs than the use of "While" and "do... While" loop.

15. List TWO methods you can use to gather user requirements for a proposed system.

16. Read the following scenario for application in a University Management System:

In ZETECH University, a student is required to register for classes within the first two weeks via the online registration system. A student will register for the individual courses they are taking and they will be required to attend lectures and sit for Continuous Assessment Tests (CATs) that constitute part of the course works. The lecturer should be able to assess the student's attendance and record their attendance via the online attendance platform, from which the percentage of attendance of the student is calculated. If it's below 75%, the student is deemed to have not attended class, hence cannot do the exam. Apart from that, the student will write exams in the semester. If they score less than 8 and less than seven, they will do supplementary. If they score less than 5, they will repeat the stage.
The department board of exams is concerned with passing verdicts.

    -i. Create a flow chart to represent the above scenario.

    -ii. In the above scenario, justify at least FOUR functional requiremnets that are necessary for implementation in the system.

17. Clearly elaborate two reasons why requirements analysis is an important stage in the software development life cycle.
