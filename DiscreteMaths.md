1.  Define the following terms:

             i. A compound proposition
             ii. A contradiction
             iii. A set

2.  List the elements in the following set; $A  =$ $\{x \, \epsilon \, N | 20<x<40~and~x~is~prime \}$

3)  Given the universal set $U$ = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7....19, 20} and sets $A$ = {9,8,10}, $B$ = {7,8,9,10,15,16,17,18}, $C$ = {1,2,3,4,19,20}, Determine:

    $i.$ $A \cup(B \cap C)$

    $ii.$ $C^c \cup B^c$

    $iii.$ $|B| + |A|$

    $iv.$ Set difference C\A

    $v.$ The symmetrical difference of set A and B

    $vi.$ The Cartesian product of set B and C

    $vii.$ The power set $P(A)$

4)  Given A = {4,5,6} and B = {a, b}; find the Cartesian product of A x B and B x A

5)  Let $f, h$ : $R \to R$ be defined by $f(x) = 3x-1$ and $g(x) = x^2-2$. Find:

    $i.$ $(h \circ f)(2)$

    $ii.$ $(f \circ h)(3)$

6)  In Kanyagia University,100 students are randomly selected. 70 like maths, 60 like Biology and 30 like both maths and biology.

         i. Represent the information on a Venn diagram
         ii. How Many students do not take either of the units

7)  Show that the proposition $p \to q$ and ~p $\vee$ q are logically equivalent

8. Use truth tables to determine whether the following compound proposition is a contradiction, tautology or a contingency.

   $i.$ [p $\vee$ q] $\Lambda$ [~p $\Lambda$~q]

   $ii.$ [p $\to$ q] $\to$ [p $\Lambda$ q]

   $iii.$ [p $\to$ q] $\leftrightarrow$ (~q $\to$~p)

9. Show that p $\to$ (q $\to$ r) is logically equivalent to (p $\Lambda$ q) $\to$ r using truth table

10. Test the validity of the argument below:

    ~p $\to$ (q $\vee$ ~r)

    p $\leftrightarrow$ (p $\Lambda$ r)

    $\therefore$ p $\to$ r

11) Given the sets, A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {2,3,4,5,6}, C = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Giving reasons, determine if;

    $i.$ Set C is a subset of set B

    $ii.$ Set A is a subset of set C

    $iii.$ Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for three sets to determine the number of elements for n($A \: \cup \: B \: \cup \: C$)

12. Define the term Venn diagram and use it to show two disjoint sets

13. An advertising agency finds that, of its 180 clients, 115 use Television, 110 use Radio and 130 use Magazines. Also 85 use Television and Magazines, 75 use Television and Radio, 95 use Radio and Magazines, 70 use all the three.

        i. Draw a venn diagram to represent these data
        ii. Find how many use any of the three media?
        iii. Find how many use only Television and not Radio and Magazines?
        iv. Find how many use Television and Magazine but not radio?

14) Determine the inverse of the functions

    $i.$ $f(x)=3x-x^2$

    $ii.$ $f(x)= \frac{2x-5}{x+7}$

15. Distinguish between the Domain and Codomain of a function

16. Write the inverse, converse and contrapositive of the following statement: "If it is raining, then Collins has his umbrella up"

17. Prove by counter example that for every real number $x$, $(x + 1)^2=x^2+1$

18. Prove that $\sqrt2$ is irrational by contradiction

19. Prove by the principle of mathematical induction:

    $1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3....+n^3=$ $[\frac{n(n+1)}{2}]^2$
